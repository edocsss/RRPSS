 * Stores information about the order invoice in the {@link Restaurant}.

 * calculate the final price ({@link #grandTotal} that {@link Customer} has to pay, and print
 * the order invoice (consist of {@link Order} details and price breakdown).
 * 
 * Before finding the {@link #grandTotal}, {@link OrderInvoice}will first compute
 * the {@link #totalPrice}, which is the sum up the price of all items that Customer 
 * purchased (both {@link AlaCarte} and {@link SetPackage} are considered)
 * multiplied with its ordered quantity. At this stage, {@link #grandTotal} will be
 * made equal to {@link #totalPrice}.
 * 
 * Afterwards, {@link OrderInvoice} will check whether {@link Customer} is a 
 * member of the {@link Restaurant}.If yes, then the {@link Customer} will receive 10%
 * {@link #DISCOUNT} from the original {@link #grandTotal} and {@link #totalDiscount}
 * would be subtracted from the {@link #grandTotal}.
 * 
 * The final price, {@link #grandTotal} is then calculated by adding the {@link #totalGST} to 
 * {@link #totalPrice}. The {@link #GST} is obtained by multiplying 7% to {@link #grandTotal}
